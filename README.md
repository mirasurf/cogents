[Project Cogents](https://github.com/caesar0301/cogents) is an initiative to develop a **cognitive, computation-driven agentic system**. To achieve this, we are assembling a set of robust, reusable building blocks for constructing **multi-agent systems (MAS)**. For the guiding philosophy behind this work, see my talk on MAS ([slides](https://github.com/caesar0301/mas-talk-2508/blob/master/mas-talk-xmingc.pdf)).

Cogents builds on several subprojects and a broad ecosystem of community libraries. Each subproject offers lightweight, modular components that bridge the *last mile* of MAS development. The design philosophy emphasizes **modularity, composability, and integration**—components can be plugged into existing infrastructures or serve as the foundation for entirely new systems.

## Subprojects

- **[cogents-core](https://github.com/mirasurf/cogents-core)**  
  Provides the foundational abstractions—**Agent, Memory, Tool, Goal, Orchestration**, and more—along with essential modules such as LLM clients, logging, message buses, model routing, and observability.

- **[cogents-tools](https://github.com/mirasurf/cogents-tools)**  
  A collection of well-tested services and toolkits for building advanced, high-level agentic applications and systems. For more [![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/mirasurf/cogents-tools)
